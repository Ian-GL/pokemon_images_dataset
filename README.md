# Pokemon Image Dataset

Dataset of Pokemon images collected by Lance Zhang and available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification).

This repo contains the same images on folders that start with the Pokedex number for each pokemon. Also some images that were missclassified are now in the correct folders.

The repo has the raw folder where images differ in size, and in the future it will also have the normalized_and_flipped folder, where all images will be normalized to a 64x64 size and it will also contain horizontally flipped versions for all of them.
